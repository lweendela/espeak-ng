//h<?> as written in Kirshenbaum (ASCII-IPA) Transcription Scheme; I can't seem to get to this voiced glottal fricative to work. That is why some of these phomenes have been commented or improvised to a degree that is understandable but an update is needed. See group h, m, n and v below where there is an h2 as a place holder
//Also vowel o(mid back rounded) and u(mid front unrounded) havent been corectly implemented since i don't really know to add a ph_chitonga file
